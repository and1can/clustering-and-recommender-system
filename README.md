#Clustering and Recommender Systems

Cluster to recognize digits.

Recommender Systems to predict jokes!


Program versions:
    python2.7
    numpy==1.11.0
    scipy==0.11.0
    matplotlib==1.1.1

How to run programs:
    #run the python files where the data is located
    #there are duplicate py files in outer directory just because I need them there to get code into latex

 Go into data/mnist_data/ to run clustering algorithm and start recognizing digits!
 1. python kmeans.py 
        to run kmeans for 1

 For the following two go into data/joke_data/ to run recommender system to predict    jokes!
 2.2 python avg.py 
        to run simple recommender system and advanced system

 2.3 python latent.py 
        to run latent factor model with mean square loss function and loss function that takes into account sparse data
